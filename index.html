            <p>In Year 1, the children enjoy a variety of enrichment activities. We have 3 exciting Entry Point Days where the children enjoy taking part in different activities and get to learn all about the stars in a space! They enjoy a Panto at Christmas time as well as a Christmas Church Visit and they love to visit our local Petts Wood Library and Crofton Woods. In Year 1, the children go on an exciting school trip and enjoy performing to their friends and family in their Easter show as well as their class assemblies. </p>
